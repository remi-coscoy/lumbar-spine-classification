# RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification

## Overview
The RSNA 2024 Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification competition is a challenge to identify medical conditions affecting the lumbar spine in MRI scans. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify different degenerative conditions in the lumbar spine.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition consists of MRI scans of the lumbar spine. The scans are labeled with various degenerative conditions affecting the lumbar spine. The task is to build a model that can classify these conditions accurately.

## Evaluation
The performance of the submitted models will be evaluated using the average of sample weighted log losses and an any_severe_spinal prediction generated by the metric.

The sample weights are as follows:

- 1 for normal/mild.
- 2 for moderate.
- 4 for severe.
